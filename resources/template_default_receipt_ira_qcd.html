<p><strong>Dear ##Name##,</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thank you for your charitable gift in the amount of ##Gross##
from your Individual Retirement Account. We are writing to acknowledge that we
received your gift postmarked ##Date## directly from your
plan trustee/administrator/custodian. Therefore, all or a portion of your gift may qualify
as a ##Year## qualified charitable distribution from your IRA under section 408(d)(8) of the
Internal Revenue Code and the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --> 

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In that connection, we warrant to you that our organization (##Organization##) is qualified as a
public charity under section 170(b)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code and that your
gift was not transferred to either a donor advised fund or a supporting organization as
described in section 509(a)(3). We further warrant that no goods or services of any
monetary value were or will be transferred to you in connection with this gift. 
Please note: A QCD is not a tax-deductible charitable
gift. A QCD may, however, count towards the annual IRA required minimum
distribution (RMD) and not be deemed taxable income. Please consult with your
own professional tax advisor regarding this and all appropriate matters. Please
retain this letter with your important tax documents and provide a copy to your tax
preparer.</p>

<p>Thank you for your generous contribution in support of ##Organization##.</p>
